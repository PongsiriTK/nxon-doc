## Roles and Permissions

The Organization feature provides three predefined roles:

- **Admin**: Can manage most features within the Organization, including inviting new members and viewing consumption data.
- **Member**: Can view the organization's consumption data and usage details.
- **Owner**: Has all the permissions of an Admin and can transfer the Owner role to another Admin.

## Activity Logs

The **Activity Logs** feature allows you to track actions taken within the Organization, including resource creation, member management, and billing updates. Logs can be filtered by action type, date, and member.

## Deleting an Organization

Since an account must be associated with an organization to exist, you cannot directly delete an organization. However, you can:

1. Transfer all resources within the organization to another organization or personal account.
2. Remove all members from the organization, leaving only yourself.
3. Transfer the Owner role to another Admin.

After completing these steps, you can contact the helpdesk for further assistance with your organization account.

## Conclusion

The Organization feature is designed to facilitate efficient collaboration for teams. By centralizing management and access control, Organizations help ensure that resources are utilized effectively and securely.
